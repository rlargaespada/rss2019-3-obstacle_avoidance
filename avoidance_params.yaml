# obstacle avoidance algorithm parameters
sect_size: 15 # angle of scans grouped together [deg]
sect_increment: 10 # +/- angle of scans between each section of laser scan [deg]
safety_dist: .4 # distance that will us to discard a scan due to one (or a few) values being too close
safety_size: 30 # +/- angle that will trigger a chunk to be discared if one (or a few) values are less than discard_dist [deg]
safety_thresh: 0.9 # proportion of safety scan that has to pass the safety distance
clearance_dist: 1.5 # [meters] threshold above which a scan is considered in open space
clearance_weight: 15 # Weight given to the minimum distance in the clearance portion of score function
goal_weight: 1.0 # weight given to the magnitude of the angle between a chunk and the goal
turn_weight: 0.5 # Weight given to the magnitude of the angle between a chunk and the last angle chosen
full_view_ang: 1.3 # angle to cause scan for best path   [deg]
max_velocity: 4.5 # velocity
