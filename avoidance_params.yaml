# obstacle avoidance algorithm parameters
sect_size: 15 # number of scans grouped together
sect_increment: 4 # number of scans between each section of laser scan
safety_dist: 0.4 # distance that will us to discard a scan due to one (or a few) values being too close
safety_size: 8 # +/- number of indices that will trigger a chunk to be discared if one (or a few) values are less than discard_dist
safety_thresh: 0.7 # proportion of safety scan that has to pass the safety distance
clearance_dist: 1.5 # [meters] threshold above which a scan is considered in open space
clearance_weight: 15 # Weight given to the minimum distance in the clearance portion of score function
goal_weight: 1.0 # weight given to the magnitude of the angle between a chunk and the goal
turn_weight: 0.5 # Weight given to the magnitude of the angle between a chunk and the last angle chosen
full_view_ang: .5 # angle to cause a dodge
max_velocity: 4.5 # velocity
wheelbase: 0.325 #pulled from our parking controller and checked with measuring tape
